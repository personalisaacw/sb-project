            HAPPY BIRTHDAY SODA!! CONGRATULATIONS ON TURNING 19!! I'm so thankful to have met
            you, you mean the whole world to me. I wouldn't want to spend my life with 
            anyone else. You're the nicest and most understanding person I have ever met, and 
            I am so glad to share two years with you! I wanted to get you something for your 
            birthday, but I didn't really know what to get since its hard for you to receive 
            physical stuff. SO I DECIDED TO SPEND TIME CODING A HAPPY BIRTHDAY WEBSITE WOOOO. 
            There is something special once you press START! I spent a lot of time 
            trying to code this website, I am writing this at 7:29 pm January 2nd lol, so 
            I really hope you enjoy. I LOVE YOUUU
